# Jenkins Views

## 🎯 Objective

The objective of this task is to configure Jenkins to run an automated scheduled job and organize related jobs under a dedicated global List View. This includes creating a new Jenkins job that executes a simple bash command, scheduling it to run periodically using a specified cron expression, and grouping relevant jobs in a customized view for better visibility and management within the Jenkins UI.
